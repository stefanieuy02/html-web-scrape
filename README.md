# html-web-scrape

Hi there!

My goal for this project was to scrape a table from the Bank of Central African States website and convert it into a pandas DataFrame (so it's readable/digestable). 

Here is the table in question.

I created two functions, one to scrape the raw data, and other to convert the data into a DataFrame.

So, this is the final product, a clean DataFrame with the extracted data!

Thanks for reading! :)
